How can we predict if a student will apply to a public or private university



multiple factors which are considered by a student before finalizing a University. These factors directly or indirectly play a very crucial role in the student’s decision making. We plan to Identify and analyze these factors with the help of a data set and aim to explore which factor or combination of factors that contribute to a student leaning towards a Private or public university



Universities will have a brief idea of what exactly about them are the attractions / distractions that are considered during a student’s decision process, allowing them to be better equipped for prospect as well as incoming students
